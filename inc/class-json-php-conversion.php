/**
 * Convert JSON definitions back to PHP code.
 *
 * The goal is that human written PHP code that uses the Brand Enforcer objects can be seamlessly encoded as JSON, but then later decoded and parsed back to working PHP.
 * The PHP output from the process should be identical in function and structure, with the only difference being the way it's formatted. We make PHP code that can pass linting for WordPress Code Standards. The original PHP code might not have been formatted that same way. For instance indenting, line breaks and other formatting may different from the original.
